  <h2>LUNA란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <strong>Luna (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST)</strong> are two native tokens of the Terra network, a blockchain-based project developed by Terra Labs in South Korea.
  <p><a href="https://www.terra.money/"
    target="_blank" title="terra is good">The Terra blockchain</a> is built on <u>Cosmos SDK;</u> a framework that allows developers to create custom blockchains and build their own decentralized applications on top of Terra for various use cases.
  As of now, The Terra ecosystem contains more than 100 of these natively built projects. These include non-fungible token (NFT) collections, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Web 3 applications.
  Founded by Do Kwon, a former Stanford University computer science grad who appeared on CoinDesk’s Most influential 2021 list, the Terra ecosystem has experienced tremendous growth recently. The market capitalization of UST grew from $180 million at the start of 2021 to almost $15 billion in March 2022, while LUNA’s price soared by 138-fold.
  In addition, the Washington Nationals baseball team announced a five-year sponsorship deal with Terra’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in February, a deal worth $40 million. It was said the team plans to accept UST as a payment option in the future.</p>

  <p>What is LUNA?
  According to Terra’s white paper, the founders’ goal was to fulfill what Bitcoin originally set out to be: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.To achieve that, Terra deploys a system of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to different assets such as commodities or fiat currencies.
  UST is by far the most popular among them and tracks the price of US dollars whereby one UST token hovers closely around the $1 mark. It achieves its peg to the dollar through the use of the ecosystem’s other token, LUNA.
  UNA plays a vital role in maintaining the price of the Terra stablecoins and reduces market volatility so they remain stable (see below).

  The price of the LUNA token has experienced an astronomical rise in price over the last year. In 2021, LUNA traded at $0.66 and closed the year at $89. Subsequently, it hit its all-time high of $104.58 on March 9, 2022, at a time when most other cryptocurrencies were falling in tandem with global capital markets catalyzed by the Ukrainian invasion crisis.
  From relative obscurity, UST has emerged to become the fourth-largest stablecoin behind tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD), surpassing $15 billion in market capitalization.</p>
